# Prelude
I made this PDF as a character creation guide specific to FoundryVTT. If you want to see the official Character Creation guide (non-specific to foundry) see the official [Agents Handbook](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AsPzqsF-yQrjhYVgcX42pBi4rlZiWA?e=5BAnEH).

I've done some of the steps out of order, because I personally feel the below is an easier way to go about making a character, but feel free to follow the official guide.
# Step 1 - Open the Character
I've made you all characters in Foundry and set you as the owner, so you should be able to open your character sheet.

I'm going to make the official pregen character for this mission (Inspector Hua) so I can walk you through it step by step. This is what the character sheet for Delta Green in FoundryVTT looks like:

# Step 2 - Choose a Profession

The most important character creation decision is to choose a profession.

This is either your character's actual day job, or the profession that best (in your opinion) represents their skillset.

[This is a link to a pdf containing all the choosable Delta Green professions.](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AsPzqsF-yQrji8Zwrr4_iSboe9EEAA?e=XycpxG)

You can also find the professions in the [Agent's handbook](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AsPzqsF-yQrjhYVgcX42pBi4rlZiWA?e=5BAnEH).

Inspector Hua is a Scientist, so I'm going to write that in the profession section of his character sheet:

# Step 3 - Set your skills.

## What is a skill?

In Delta Green, the skills your character has determine the kinds of things they're able to do. They are similar to DnD or Pathfinder skills, although unlike those systems they are just a flat number between 0 and 100, without any modifiers from your attributes.

To succeed at a check, you will roll a d100, and if you meet or beat your skill number you succeed. Essentially, if you have a 40 in a skill, you have a 40% to succeed a roll at it.

This table shows the rough real-world equivalency of having a certain % in a skill:

## Setting the skills in Foundry

You'll want to open the Skills tab of your character sheet:
